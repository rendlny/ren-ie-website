            I had previously been working as a Software Engineer at
            Inkerman Technologies where I had been using PHP with the Laravel
            framework, along with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Ajax & jQuery to build
            websites with CMS and web-based bespoke systems such as inventory
            management, ticketing and sales systems.

          I was one of the main software engineers at Inkerman Technologies
          where I worked in a fast-paced development schedule. l worked on over
          15 different bespoke systems for clients in various industries, such
          as ticket booking, dance school management and e-commerce systems. I
          also built custom websites for clients along with a CMS to allow
          clients to add blog-posts, gallery images, event listings etc. to
          their website. I would use PHP with Bootstrap, JS, Ajax, jQuery, MySQL
          and the Laravel framework to build these systems and websites. I've
          set up Linux cloud machines, prepared their databases and deployed
          the systems onto them. I've also built Python web scrapers to collect
          data to be put onto new systems.

          I worked on both the front and back-end of major projects with my team
          by following Scrum and Agile methodologies using Jira Kanban boards
          to deliver projects in a timely and efficient manner. In my 2 years
          of working at Inkerman Technologies, I grew more confident in my
          coding abilities and increased my skill set a great deal.

          During this course, I got an overview of cloud technologies such as
          learning about cloud machines, load balancers, etc. while also gaining
          experience with this tech by using AWS.

              I was selected by the Head of the Computing Department of DKIT,
              Christian Horn, as one of 14 students from DKIT to participate in the
              GGULIVRR @ Łódź 2017 project. This project took place in Łódź, Poland
              and was a two-week programme where we worked in teams of 5, consisting
              of students from different colleges across Europe to create a
              contextual application based around the city of Łódź. We worked on our
              application idea for 2 weeks and then presented it to our fellow
              participants and industry professionals. It was a great experience to
              participate in.

          During this course, the main programming language I learned was Java
          but I also learned some PHP and C#. I gained knowledge on many
          technologies such as design patterns, networks, security, SQL, Oracle,
          JSP, SOAP & REST, Photoshop, Powershell & CSS.
