            I have 2 years of experience as a main software engineer at Inkerman
            Technologies where I worked on over 15
            different bespoke systems for clients in various industries, such as
            ticket booking systems, dance school systems and e-commerce systems,
            in a fast-paced development schedule using PHP with JS, Ajax, jQuery,
            MySQL and the Laravel framework. I deployed these systems to Linux cloud machines.
            <br><br>
            I worked on both the front and back-end of major projects with my
            team by following Scrum and Agile methodologies using Jira Kanban
            boards to deliver projects in a timely & efficient manner.  In my
            2 years of working at Inkerman Technologies, I grew more confident
            in my coding abilities and increased my skill set a great deal.

            I have built webscrapers in python, including one for the open source
            project <a href="https://yokaidex.netlify.app/" target="_blank">YokaiDex</a>,
             which is a handy web app for guides and info on the
            Yokai Watch video games. For this webscraper, I used the beautifulSoup
            package to pull the websites code and search through it to grab the required data
            which I build an object for and then print into a json file to be used
            by the web app. You can see the webscraper code on the
            <a href="https://github.com/rendlny/YokaidexWebscraper" target="_blank">github repo</a>.

            Another Python project I have built is
            <a href="https://github.com/rendlny/rapuli-bot" target="_blank">Rapuli-Bot</a>,
            a Discord chat-Bot for tracking weekly turnip stock prices for the
            game Animal Crossing New Horizons on Nintendo Switch. This bot will
            take inputs from the user of their turnip prices and will then
            return a link to <a href="https://turnipprophet.io/" target="_blank">TurnipProphet</a>
            with their price data already set. Everytime they set a price,
            the bot will update the link with their new pricing.
