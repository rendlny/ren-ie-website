            I have 2 years of experience using PHP with JS, Ajax, jQuery and
            phpMyAdmin to create web applications such as shop, inventory
            management, bookings & article systems. Worked on major projects with
            my team by following Scrum / Agile methodologies and the use of
            Jira Kanban boards to deliver projects in a timely and efficient
            manner.

            I have built webscrapers in python, including one for the open source
            project <a href="https://yokaidex.netlify.app/" target="_blank">YokaiDex</a>,
             which is a handy web app for guides and info on the
            Yokai Watch video games. For this webscraper, I used the beautifulSoup
            package to pull the websites code and search through it to grab the required data
            which I build an object for and then print into a json file to be used
            by the web app. You can see the webscraper code on the
            <a href="https://github.com/rendlny/YokaidexWebscraper" target="_blank">github repo</a>.

            Another Python project I have built is
            <a href="https://github.com/rendlny/rapuli-bot" target="_blank">Rapuli-Bot</a>,
            a Discord chat-Bot for tracking weekly turnip stock prices for the
            game Animal Crossing New Horizons on Nintendo Switch. This bot will
            take inputs from the user of their turnip prices and will then
            return a link to <a href="https://turnipprophet.io/" target="_blank">TurnipProphet</a>
            with their price data already set. Everytime they set a price,
            the bot will update the link with their new pricing.
