            I got into board gaming in the summer of 2020. 
            I'd purchased my first board game Call to Adventure: The Stormlight Adventure.
            As a fan of The Stormlight Archive series, I bought it for the beautiful artwork 
            but while trying to find more info on the game I stumbled upon 
            <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/" target="_blank">BGG</a> and was 
            quickly pulled into the world of board gaming when I realized the huge amount 
            of board games that exist.

            I started with Ticket To Ride then moved on to Terraforming Mars! 
            Now I enjoy keeping up with the latest Kickstarter board games and 
            am super excited to play

            My favourite type of board games is cooperative games.
            I love working together to solve the issue at hand whether it is
            dealing with a horde of zombies heading towards us in

            or preventing outbreaks of diseases in
