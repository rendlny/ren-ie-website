            I got into boardgaming in the summer of 2020, it all started
            when I purchased Call to Adventure: The Stormlight Adventure.
            As a Stormlight fan I'd bought it for the beautiful artwork
            on every card but I was soon pulled into the world of boardgaming
            when I discovered <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/" target="_blank">BGG</a>
            and realised the huge amount of board games that exist.
            I started with Ticket To Ride then moved on to Terraforming Mars! Now I have backed a bunch of
            Kickstarter board games that I am excited to play! The two that I am
            most excited for are
            <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/251661/oathsworn-deepwood" target="_blank">Oathsworn</a> and
            <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/285036/shadow-kingdoms-valeria" target="_blank">Shadow Kingdoms of Valeria</a>.
